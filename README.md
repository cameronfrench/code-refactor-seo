# Code Refactor SEO

## Description

In this project, I evaluated and modified exisiting source code from Horiseon so that it could better follow accessibility standards
so that their own site is better optimized for search engine. The exisiting HTML proved to be inaccessible, as well as CSS, causing issues for those 
with disabilties or impairments that could possiblity interact with the website. The inaccessibility of the source code also didn't provide the site with 
optimization value for search engines. Through modifying HTML and CSS, I learned that a more concise, semantic code is invaulable to the user experience while 
providing the ability for search engines to read the code more effeciently, to the benefit of the website owner.
